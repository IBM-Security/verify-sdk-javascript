## User flow
- Click the `Authorize` button to call the Authorization server to retrieve a valid device code.
- Copy the code and goto the provided link to authenticate using the device code or use a secondary device to scan the QR code for a better user experience.
- The application begins polling the authorization server for a valid access token
- When the authentication process is complete you can use the valid access token to to call your API and retrieve requested data.

The IBM Verify Javascript SDK also supports the ability to manage IBM Verify registration profiles. You can read more about how this is implemented [here](http://developer.ice.ibmcloud.com/verify/javascript/ibm-verify-sdk-object-model/authenticator-context). :rocket:
